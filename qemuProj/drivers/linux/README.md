Linux driver specific documentation:

There are a bunch of quick guides online to build a linux kernel module, I won't write down anything specific.  I tried using github copilot at first just to see what it could do, that was interesting.  Ended up writing the makefile from scratch anyway :')

Anyway, I haven't attached anything to anything yet, just got the foundations down.
