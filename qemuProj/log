Added Febrary 1st, 2025:

The intent of this project is to make an easy to follow implementation of a top-to-bottom, hardware to user, programmable PCI device in windows. I'll be using a basic build of Qemu with a custom PCI device injected to start up a windows VM.  I'll be tracking general details here, see log for building details/tutorials

TODO:
[x] Get qemu building 
[ ] Get win64 image loading/running/accessible via remote desktop
[ ] Add custom qemu PCI device to image
[ ] Establish logging for qemu device
[x] Add basic windows kernel driver
[ ] Attach kernel driver to qemu device
[ ] Communicate kernel driver -> qemu device, via I/O
[x] Add windows user-mode driver
[ ] Connect to and use user-mode driver
[ ] Connect user-mode and kernel driver
[ ] Establish user to device interactions

Other possibilities?
[ ] Python library
[ ] Debugging tools (symbol production, link source)
[ ] VM Infrastructure/management tools
[ ] Linux VM and Driver(s)
