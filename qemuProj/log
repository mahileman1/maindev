For building qemu, I had some helpful resources.
I *think* the correct order is B, C&D, A:

A. PDF detailing the steps to compile and add device for qemu windows instance.  It's an ebook written by Apriorit Inc. called "How to Develop Embedded Software Using theh QEMU Machine Emulator"
This requires a qemu build that already works, and is based in ubuntu.  Since I don't want to run windows inside of ubuntu inside of windows, I'm building windows in windows...right? 
Qemu configuration details start on page 28 for my PDF. Make'ing take a while. 
# Important note: Use the curly apostrophe (non-shift tilda key), or copy and paste it from below to use the curly apostrophes.  Otherwise the ldflags argument will fail. 
./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-sdl --enable-debug --extra-ldflags="`pkg-config --libs openssl`"

B. Quick note, but no details on official docs: https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/about/build-platforms.html#windows
C. More details, using msys2: https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/W32#Native_builds_with_MSYS2
D. For above, some corrections based on random googling:
- Instead of opening ucrt64.exe after package installations, open MSYS2 mingw_64 in administrator
- I may or may not have had to add the following two lines:
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-meson
