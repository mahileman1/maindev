## Projects:
### qemuProj
An attempt to make a top-to-bottom emulated device and kernel/user Windows driver, maybe even an SDK.  Using qemu PCI device emulation.

I'm compiling the project on windows, see log for more install/reproduction details.

### stm32CanProj
Looking into possibly emulating an ABS solenoid with an stm32, to remove said solenoid from a motorcycle.  Need to grab and spoof CAN messages to avoid the ECU freaking out. Practical? No. Safe? Also...no.
As of February 1st, 2025, this project is stalled since I accidentally bought an stm32 without a CAN controller.  I'm making $11/hr.  RIP
